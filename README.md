ðŸ“Šâ€¯Dataset

All data is unified in SQL views.

Fields

Column	Description
Symbol	Ticker symbol
Timestamp	Trading day
Open / High / Low / Close	OHLC prices
Volume	Shares traded

ðŸ“ˆâ€¯Predictionâ€¯Model
A simple linearâ€‘regression model forecasts closing prices from historical data.
While not intended for professional trading, it demonstrates integrating predictive analytics into a relational app.

ðŸ“¡â€¯Socialâ€¯Interaction
Friend management (requests, acceptance, removal)

Share stock lists privately or publicly

Write and read reviews on shared/public lists

Assumptions
Friendships are mutual

Stock lists default to private or public, then can be shared individually

Users add price data for existing tickers, not brandâ€‘new tickers

Every user starts with one default portfolio

Supported transactions: deposit, withdraw, buy, sell, transfer
